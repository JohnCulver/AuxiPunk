#AuxiPunk


##What is it?
* AuxiPunk is an auxiliary AS3 library built on top of [FlashPunk](https://github.com/Draknek/FlashPunk "FlashPunk") (**Auxliary** [additional] **Punk** or **Auxilium** [assistance] **Punk**).   
* It is intended primarily to take the place of boilerplate code frequently written, or copy pasted, into game jam games.
* Currently the library includes these utilities: 
 * platformer physics including one-way platforms
 * a platformer level parser for Tiled tmx files
 * lighting
 * bullet patterns
 * text dialogs (like rpg style)
 * bars (can be used for health guages/timers etc)
 * periodic "spawning" (waves)
 * screen shaking
 * screen partitioning 
 * examples/demos of everything mentioned above (see ExampleMain)
 * etc!
