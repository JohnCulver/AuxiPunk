#AuxiPunk


##What is it?
* AuxiPunk is an auxiliary AS3 library built on top of [FlashPunk](https://github.com/Draknek/FlashPunk "FlashPunk") (**Auxliary** [additional] **Punk** or **Auxilium** [assistance] **Punk**).   
* It is intended primarily to take the place of boilerplate code frequently written, or copy pasted, into game jam games.
* Currently the library includes some simple: 
 * platformer physics including one-way platforms
 * a platformer level parser for Tiled tmx files
 * lighting 
 * object pooling
 * bullet pattern design utilities 
 * screen partitioning 
 * a few other random things that get reused frequently
